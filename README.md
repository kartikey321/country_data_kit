## Why Choose This Package?

Unlike other packages that use static JSON data, our Country-State-City Database Package utilizes Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for data storage and retrieval. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Protobuf serialization is more compact than JSON, resulting in smaller data size and lower memory usage.

2. **Faster Parsing**: Protobuf is designed for efficient serialization and deserialization, leading to quicker data loading times.

3. **Type Safety**: Protobuf provides strong typing, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors due to data inconsistencies.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Protobuf allows for easy schema evolution, ensuring your code remains compatible with future data updates.

5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: The use of protobuf ensures consistent data representation across different platforms and languages.

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  country_state_city_v1: ^1.0.0
```

Then run:

```
dart pub get
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the Country-State-City Database Package:

```dart
import 'package:country_state_city_v1/country_state_city_v1.dart';

void main() async {
  final provider = ServerDataProvider();
  await provider.initialize();

  // Get all countries
  final countries = provider.getAllCountries();
  print('Total countries: ${countries.length}');

  // Get states for a specific country (e.g., USA)
  final usaStates = provider.getStatesForCountry(840); // 840 is the country code for USA
  print('Total states in USA: ${usaStates.length}');

  // Get cities for a specific state (e.g., California)
  final californiaCities = provider.getCitiesForState(1439); // 1439 is the state code for California
  print('Total cities in California: ${californiaCities.length}');

  // Get a country by ISO2 code
  final usa = provider.getCountryByIso2('US');
  print('Country name: ${usa?.name}');
}
```
